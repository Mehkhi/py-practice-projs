# Checklist â€” 01-flask-crud-to-do

## Implementation Order
- [ ] R1. Data model & migrations (2/5)
- [ ] R2. Auth: register/login/logout with password hashing (3/5)
- [ ] R3. CRUD with filtering, sort, and pagination (3/5)
- [ ] R4. Flash messages & error handling (2/5)

## Tasks

- [ ] R1. Data model & migrations (2/5)
  - [ ] `alembic upgrade head` creates tables reliably; downgrade works.
  - [ ] Index present on `(user_id, completed, due_at)`.

- [ ] R2. Auth: register/login/logout with password hashing (3/5)
  - [ ] New user can register and log in; wrong password rejected without timing leak.
  - [ ] CSRF token required on POST forms.

- [ ] R3. CRUD with filtering, sort, and pagination (3/5)
  - [ ] List view supports `?status=open&sort=due_at&page=2` and is stable across refreshes.

- [ ] R4. Flash messages & error handling (2/5)
  - [ ] All CRUD flows show success/error flashes; custom 404/500 pages served.

## Bonus

- [ ] B1. RBAC and ownership checks (3/5)

- [ ] B2. Admin panel (3/5)

- [ ] B3. Rate limiting & audit log (3/5)
