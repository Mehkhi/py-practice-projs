### 17) Graph Algorithms Visualizer
**What you’re building:** Visualize BFS/DFS/shortest paths on graphs.
**Core skills:** networkx, matplotlib, algorithms, data structures.

#### Required Features
- **R1. Graph ingestion** — **Difficulty 2/5**
  - **What it teaches:** Reading edge lists/adjacency; validation.
  - **Acceptance criteria:** Bad edges reported; graph summary printed.

- **R2. BFS/DFS traversals** — **Difficulty 2/5**
  - **What it teaches:** Frontier/visited sets; parent pointers.
  - **Acceptance criteria:** Traversal order shown; correctness tests.

- **R3. Shortest paths (Dijkstra)** — **Difficulty 3/5**
  - **What it teaches:** Priority queues; weights; path reconstruction.
  - **Acceptance criteria:** Path cost matches reference.

- **R4. Drawing** — **Difficulty 2/5**
  - **What it teaches:** Layouts; highlighting paths/visited nodes.
  - **Acceptance criteria:** Saved image with legend and annotations.

#### Bonus Features
- **B1. Interactive GUI** — **Difficulty 3/5**
  - **Teaches:** PyQt/PySimpleGUI controls; step‑through animations.
  - **Acceptance:** Buttons control algorithm steps; speed adjustable.

- **B2. A* heuristic** — **Difficulty 3/5**
  - **Teaches:** Heuristics; admissibility; consistency.
  - **Acceptance:** A* equals Dijkstra on zero heuristic; faster on good heuristic.

- **B3. Performance benchmarking** — **Difficulty 2/5**
  - **Teaches:** Big‑O discussion; empirical timing.
  - **Acceptance:** Benchmark report across sizes/densities.
