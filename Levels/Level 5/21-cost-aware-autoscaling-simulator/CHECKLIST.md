# Checklist — 21-cost-aware-autoscaling-simulator

## Implementation Order
- [ ] R1. Workload & service model (3/5)
- [ ] R2. Scaling policies (3/5)
- [ ] R3. Cost model (2/5)
- [ ] R4. SLA vs cost frontier (2/5)

## Tasks

- [ ] R1. Workload & service model (3/5)
  - [ ] Sim matches analytical expectations on simple M/M/1 cases.

- [ ] R2. Scaling policies (3/5)
  - [ ] Policies configurable; stability under oscillation.

- [ ] R3. Cost model (2/5)
  - [ ] Cost tracked per scenario; plotted with SLA.

- [ ] R4. SLA vs cost frontier (2/5)
  - [ ] Frontier chart produced; scenario runner outputs CSV.

## Bonus

- [ ] B1. RL policy search (4/5)

- [ ] B2. Multi‑tier microservices (3/5)

- [ ] B3. Spot/preemptible economics (3/5)
