# Checklist — 15-high-throughput-http-server

## Implementation Order
- [ ] R1. Baseline & SLOs (2/5)
- [ ] R2. Load tests & flamecharts (3/5)
- [ ] R3. Optimizations (3/5)
- [ ] R4. Backpressure & overload protection (3/5)

## Tasks

- [ ] R1. Baseline & SLOs (2/5)
  - [ ] Baseline charts saved; SLOs documented.

- [ ] R2. Load tests & flamecharts (3/5)
  - [ ] Flamegraphs identify top bottlenecks; regressions tracked.

- [ ] R3. Optimizations (3/5)
  - [ ] Throughput improved ≥ X%; tail latency reduced.

- [ ] R4. Backpressure & overload protection (3/5)
  - [ ] Under overload, system stays responsive with bounded latency.

## Bonus

- [ ] B1. TLS optimization (3/5)

- [ ] B2. Kernel tuning (3/5)

- [ ] B3. eBPF profiling (3/5)
