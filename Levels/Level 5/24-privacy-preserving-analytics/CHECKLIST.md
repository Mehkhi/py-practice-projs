## Implementation Order
- [ ] R1. Mechanism (Laplace/Gaussian) (3/5)
- [ ] R2. Composition/accounting (3/5)
- [ ] R3. DP query API (3/5)
- [ ] R4. Utility vs privacy plots (2/5)

## Tasks

- [ ] R1. Mechanism (Laplace/Gaussian) (3/5)
  - [ ] Tests validate privacy budget vs error trade‑off.

- [ ] R2. Composition/accounting (3/5)
  - [ ] Budgets enforced per user/session with audit trail.

- [ ] R3. DP query API (3/5)
  - [ ] API refuses over‑budget requests; returns calibrated results otherwise.

- [ ] R4. Utility vs privacy plots (2/5)
  - [ ] Plots generated and explained in README.

## Bonus

- [ ] B1. Federated learning sim (4/5)

- [ ] B2. Membership inference tests (3/5)

- [ ] B3. K‑anonymity lints (2/5)
