# Checklist — 25-observability-platform

## Implementation Order
- [ ] R1. Collectors & pipelines (3/5)
- [ ] R2. Logs/metrics/traces unification (3/5)
- [ ] R3. SLOs & burn‑rate alerts (3/5)
- [ ] R4. Dashboards & runbooks (2/5)

## Tasks

- [ ] R1. Collectors & pipelines (3/5)
  - [ ] Data flows end‑to‑end; dropped spans/metrics < threshold.

- [ ] R2. Logs/metrics/traces unification (3/5)
  - [ ] From a log you can jump to a trace and related metrics.

- [ ] R3. SLOs & burn‑rate alerts (3/5)
  - [ ] Alerts fire appropriately in test; runbook linked.

- [ ] R4. Dashboards & runbooks (2/5)
  - [ ] Dashboards cover latency, error rate, saturation; runbooks reviewed.

## Bonus

- [ ] B1. Auto‑instrumentation playbooks (2/5)

- [ ] B2. Ingestion gateway (3/5)

- [ ] B3. Cardinality controls (3/5)
