# Custom Fonts

This directory exists for organizational purposes. Custom font files are **not required** for the game to function.

## Status

Custom fonts are not currently planned for this project. The game uses system fonts which work across all platforms.

## Notes

- The `AssetManager` has placeholder support for `.ttf` and `.otf` formats if custom fonts are ever added
- The game automatically falls back to system fonts
- Font sizes are scaled automatically based on the game's scale factor
