# Audio Assets

This directory exists for organizational purposes. Audio files are **not required** for the game to function.

## Status

Audio support is not currently planned for this project. The game operates fully without sound effects or music.

## Notes

- The `AssetManager` has placeholder support for `.wav`, `.ogg`, and `.mp3` formats if audio is ever added
- The game gracefully handles missing audio files with no errors
