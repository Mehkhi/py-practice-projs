# Project Checklist Revision Report

**Date**: October 2, 2025
**Task**: Complete revision of all project checklists and spec sheets across 5 levels
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED

## Summary

Successfully revised **127 project checklists** across all 5 difficulty levels to ensure proper skill progression from novice to principal engineer level.

## Changes Made

### Before
- Highly repetitive checklists across all levels
- No clear difficulty progression
- Generic requirements that didn't scale
- Inconsistent expectations
- Difficulty ratings not aligned with actual complexity

### After
- Unique, tailored checklists for each project
- Clear progression from beginner to advanced
- Level-appropriate requirements and expectations
- Properly scaled difficulty ratings (1-5/5)
- Completion criteria matched to skill level

## Breakdown by Level

### Level 1: Novice (26 projects)
- **Focus**: Python basics, first programs
- **Difficulty**: 1-3/5
- **Tests**: 3-5 basic unit tests
- **Documentation**: Simple README
- **Examples**: Calculator, Guess the Number, Temperature Converter

### Level 2: Junior (25 projects)
- **Focus**: Practical tools, APIs, databases, CLI
- **Difficulty**: 2-3/5
- **Tests**: 8-12 tests including edge cases
- **Documentation**: README + docstrings + examples
- **Examples**: CLI Notes, Weather API, Web Scraper, Flask Mini API

### Level 3: Mid-Level (25 projects)
- **Focus**: Web applications, architecture, async, testing
- **Difficulty**: 2-4/5
- **Tests**: 15-25 tests, >70% coverage
- **Documentation**: Full docs, API specs, ADRs
- **Examples**: Flask CRUD, REST API, Async Scraper, Docker, Testing Workshop

### Level 4: Senior (25 projects)
- **Focus**: Production systems, scalability, observability
- **Difficulty**: 3-5/5
- **Tests**: 30-50 tests (unit, integration, E2E, load, chaos)
- **Documentation**: Runbooks, SLOs, ADRs, DR procedures
- **Examples**: FastAPI Production, Kafka Pipeline, Observability Stack, Security Hardening

### Level 5: Principal (26 projects)
- **Focus**: Distributed systems, platforms, custom infrastructure
- **Difficulty**: 4-5/5
- **Tests**: 50+ tests, distributed testing, formal verification
- **Documentation**: RFCs, design docs, technical specifications
- **Examples**: Consensus (RAFT), Database Engine, Vector Search, Time-Series Store

## Key Improvements

### 1. Progressive Difficulty
Each level builds on previous skills while introducing new concepts:
- L1 → L2: From basic Python to practical tools
- L2 → L3: From tools to complete applications
- L3 → L4: From applications to production systems
- L4 → L5: From systems to platforms and infrastructure

### 2. Scaled Requirements
Test requirements increase appropriately:
- L1: 3-5 basic tests
- L2: 8-12 tests
- L3: 15-25 tests (70% coverage)
- L4: 30-50 tests (E2E, load, chaos)
- L5: 50+ tests (distributed, formal verification)

### 3. Documentation Expectations
Documentation scales with complexity:
- L1: Simple usage README
- L2: Installation, examples, docstrings
- L3: Architecture overview, API docs
- L4: Runbooks, SLOs, disaster recovery
- L5: RFCs, design docs, specifications

### 4. Code Quality Standards
Quality expectations increase:
- L1: Basic formatting (black)
- L2: black + ruff, type hints on public functions
- L3: Full type coverage, mypy strict
- L4: CI/CD, security scans, benchmarks
- L5: Production-grade, security audits, profiling

### 5. Realistic Complexity Ratings
Features now have accurate difficulty ratings:
- 1/5: Basic implementation, single concept
- 2/5: Multiple concepts, some complexity
- 3/5: Non-trivial algorithms or architecture
- 4/5: Advanced algorithms, distributed systems
- 5/5: Cutting-edge, research-level

## Additional Documentation

Created two supporting documents:

1. **PROGRESSION_SUMMARY.md**
   - Overview of all 5 levels
   - Focus areas for each level
   - Example projects
   - Completion criteria
   - Skill progression map
   - Suggested learning path (2-5 years)

2. **REVISION_REPORT.md** (this file)
   - Summary of changes
   - Before/after comparison
